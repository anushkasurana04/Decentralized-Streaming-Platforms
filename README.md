# Decentralized Streaming Platforms

## Project Description

The Decentralized Streaming Platforms project is a revolutionary blockchain-based solution that enables content creators to monetize their live streams through real-time micro-payments. Unlike traditional streaming platforms that rely on centralized payment systems and take substantial cuts from creators' earnings, this decentralized platform empowers creators with direct peer-to-peer payments and transparent revenue sharing.

Built on Ethereum using Solidity smart contracts, the platform allows viewers to pay creators per second of content consumed, creating a fair and immediate compensation model. The system eliminates intermediaries, reduces fees, and provides creators with instant access to their earnings while maintaining complete transparency through blockchain technology.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to democratize content creation and consumption by building a decentralized ecosystem where:

- **Creators have full control** over their content pricing and revenue streams
- **Viewers pay only for what they consume** through micro-payment mechanisms
- **Transparent economics** ensure fair compensation for all parties
- **Global accessibility** breaks down geographical and financial barriers
- **Community governance** shapes the platform's future development
- **Innovation thrives** through open-source, decentralized infrastructure

We aim to create a sustainable, creator-first economy that rewards quality content and fosters genuine community engagement without the limitations of traditional centralized platforms.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Hardhat development environment
- MetaMask or compatible Web3 wallet
- Sufficient ETH for gas fees

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DecentralizedStreamingPlatforms.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd DecentralizedStreamingPlatforms

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile smart contracts
npx hardhat compile
